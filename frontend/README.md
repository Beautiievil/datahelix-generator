# Data com.scottlogic.deg.generator.Generator Frontend

Web app for the Data com.scottlogic.deg.generator.Generator. Acts as the primary point of interaction with the service, where users can:

* Derive profiles from data
* Create profiles from scratch
* Load or save profiles
* Generate data according to profiles

### Technologies

Written in TypeScript, built with React and Redux, using [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). Originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (documentation [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)).

### Build
For dev purposes you'll usually want to run `npm start`, which will build the application, set up an auto-reload-enabled local web server and open the webpage in your default browser.

For other build types, see the Create React App documentation linked above.
