Feature: User can specify the length of generated string data using 'ofLength'

Background:
     Given the generation strategy is full
       And there is a field foo
       And foo is of type "string"

Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string should be successful
     Given foo is of length <length>
       And foo is in set:
         | "a"  |
         | "aa" |
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo        |
       | null       |
       | <expected> |
     Examples:
       | length | expected |
       | 1      | "a"      |
       | 2      | "aa"     |
       | 1.0    | "a"      |

Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a negation of a valid numeric length should be successful
     Given foo is anything but of length <length>
       And foo is in set:
         | "a"  |
         | "aa" |
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo        |
       | null       |
       | <expected> |
     Examples:
       | length | expected |
       | 1      | "aa"     |
       | 2      | "a"      |

Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string value and white space should be successful
     Given foo is of length 10
       And foo is in set:
         | "a"          |
         | "  10  10  " |
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo          |
       | null         |
       | "  10  10  " |

Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' for a length of zero should be successful
     Given foo is of length 0
       And foo is in set:
         | ""  |
         | "a" |
     Then the following data should be generated:
       | foo  |
       | null |
       | ""   |

Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a decimal number containing non zero digits should fail with an error message
     Given foo is of length <length>
       And foo is in set:
         | "1" |
     Then I am presented with an error message
     Examples:
       | length      |
       | 1.1         |
       | 1.01        |
       | 1.10        |
       | 1.010       |
       | 1.000000001 |
       | 1.9         |

Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a value that is not a valid number should fail with an error
     Given foo is of length <length>
       And foo is in set:
         | "a" |
     Then I am presented with an error message
       And no data is created
     Examples:
       | length                    |
       | -1                        |
       | "1"                       |
       | "1.1"                     |
       | "1,000"                   |
       | "100,00"                  |
       | "010"                     |
       | "Â£1.00"                   |
       | "-1"                      |
       | "+1"                      |
       | "Infinity"                |
       | "NaN"                     |
       | "nil"                     |
       | "$1.00"                   |
       | "1E+02"                   |
       | "001 000"                 |
       | "2010-01-01T00:00:00.000" |
       | "2010-01-01T00:00"        |
       | "1st Jan 2010"            |
       | "a"                       |
       | ""                        |
