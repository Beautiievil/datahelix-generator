The generation of representative test and simulation data is a challenging and time-consuming task. The DataHelix generator allows you to quickly create data, based on a JSON profile that defines fields and the relationships between them, for the purpose of testing and validation. The generator supports a number of generation modes, allowing the creation of data that both conforms to, or violates, the profile.

DataHelix is a proud member of the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/) and operates within the [Data Technologies Program](https://www.finos.org/dt).

For a high level road map see [Road Map](docs/RoadMap.md).
